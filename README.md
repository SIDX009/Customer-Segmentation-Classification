Customer Segmentation Classification Project
Overview:
This project focuses on developing and implementing a Customer Segmentation Classification model for an automobile company planning market expansion. The objective is to predict customer segments (A, B, C, D) in new markets based on existing market behaviors, tackling challenges like missing data, complex customer behaviors, and model optimization.

Key Objectives:
Prediction of Customer Segments: Utilize machine learning techniques to predict customer segments (A, B, C, D) for the automobile company's products in new markets.
Data Challenges: Address missing data in key features and explore complex customer behaviors.
Model Optimization: Optimize the performance of the classification model for accurate predictions.
Dataset & Features:
The dataset includes information on customers in the existing market, including age, gender, marital status, education, profession, work experience, family size, spending score, and de-identified categories (Var_1).

Techniques and Tools Used:
Data analysis and preprocessing using pandas and Numpy.
Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Handling missing data and outliers.
Feature engineering to create new features.
Data encoding for categorical features.
Machine learning models include Gradient Boosting, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.
Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and classification reports.
Power BI Dashboard:
The project includes a Power BI dashboard for comprehensive visualization and exploration of key insights.
Conclusion:
The Gradient Boosting Classifier emerged as the best-performing model with an accuracy of 0.53, making it the recommended choice for predicting customer segments in new markets. Among the segments, Segment D (Class 3) demonstrated the highest F1-Score, signifying it as the best-performing segment.
